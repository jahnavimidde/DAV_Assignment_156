Crop Recommendation Data Analysis

This project analyzes the **Crop Recommendation Dataset** using Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. The dataset includes soil nutrient levels, weather conditions, and recommended crops.

## Dataset: `Crop_recommendation.csv`

| Column Name   | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `N`           | Nitrogen content in soil             |
| `P`           | Phosphorus content in soil           |
| `K`           | Potassium content in soil            |
| `temperature` | Temperature in Â°C                    |
| `humidity`    | Relative humidity (%)                |
| `ph`          | pH value of the soil                 |
| `rainfall`    | Rainfall in mm                       |
| `label`       | Recommended crop                     |
